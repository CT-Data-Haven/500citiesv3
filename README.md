# 500 Cities Project: Connecticut

The following data is from the 500 Cities Project of the CDC, CDC Foundation, and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The project makes available estimates of a variety of measures of public health at the census tract-level, allowing cities to better understand health issues locally.

The map here displays city- and tract-level data for the 8 cities in Connecticut included in the project. More information on the 500 Cities Project is [available from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/). Data was updated by CDC in December 2017.

Values for cities are shown in the chart at bottom. Choose a city to view its data by tract. Choose the tract summary view to see a histogram of all tract-level data.
